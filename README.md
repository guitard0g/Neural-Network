# Neural-Network
Creating a backwards propagating neural network from scratch in pure python

This is an old project I worked on in high school when I was teaching myself the nitty gritty

of neural networks. 

files perc1.py - perc7.py and ann7.py are all building blocks of a fully functioning neural network

with one hidden layer. I wrote these small pieces in order to make sure I could get them working before

taking on a back propagating neural net. 

backProp.py is the final product.
